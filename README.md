# Mocking 3rd party code

It’s useful to have a vocabularly for talking about refactoring. It will help you to communicate when doing strong-style pairing or mob programming. In this learning hour we’ll learn what refactorings are and the names of some of them. We’ll also practice applying Extract Function in order to address a Long Function smell.


## Learning Goals

    ~~Remember the name of the refactoring “Extract Function” aka “Extract Method”~~
    ~~Identify a situation when you can successfully apply “Extract Function” or “Extract Method”~~

## Session Outline

    5 min connect: collect names of refactorings
    5 min concept: Martin Fowler’s refactoring definitions
    10 mins do: review code and suggest refactorings
    10 min demo: Extract function
    25 min do: pairs refactor
    5 min reflect: own definition of refactoring
