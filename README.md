Note: 

This readme is for me, for using this learning hour, I'd copy it into a new repository without the readme.
For a remote session, mentimeter can be used to gather people's answers.

# Mocking 3rd party code




## Learning Goals

    ~~Remember the name of the refactoring “Extract Function” aka “Extract Method”~~
    ~~Identify a situation when you can successfully apply “Extract Function” or “Extract Method”~~

## Session Outline

    5 min connect: 
    5 min concept: 
    10 mins do: review code and talk about my thoughts and problems
    10 min demo: showcase necessary test updates when doing mock approach, show test using mockwebserver instead
    25 min do: let people try it out to learn about mockwebserver
    5 min reflect: 

## Connect

Gather people around a whiteboard and ask them to name and write up qualities of good tests.

## Concept

Trustworthy, Readable, Maintainable

## Concrete

Let's refactor towards readability.

## Conclusion


Reflect

    Think about what we did today. 
    If you're asked now about qualities of good tests, what comes yo your mind?
